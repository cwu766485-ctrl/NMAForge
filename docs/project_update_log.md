# Project update log

## Round 27 — incomplete session

Prepared historical baseline extracts and an incomplete review at `docs/benchmark/NMAFORGE_V2_ROUND27_ARCHITECTURE_FREEZE_REVIEW.md`. Withdrew unsupported LayerNorm phase allocations; phases remain unmeasured. Corrected large GEMM historical read traffic to 6,144 B. No RTL experiment, simulation, synthesis, freeze decision, commit or push completed. Historical extraction uses `git show 800c5b0:<artifact-path>`. Git metadata writes failed with read-only `.git/index.lock`; escalation was aborted.

## GEMM / LN scheduling optimization — published candidate

Branch renamed to `nmaforge`; old remote `nmaforege` removed after verifying the
new remote. RTL/test SHA `b2b3b0b5942f9218ed574a04e946104109dc2c99`. Two bounded
changes overlap GEMM A/B prefetch and LN Gamma arithmetic/Beta fetch, with no new
data state or SPAD ports. Same H16 decode: 66,931 → 65,771 cycles / 8 tokens;
trained CNN CMDQ: 12,947 → 12,351, unchanged independent Golden and traffic.
Three-seed Matrix/SFU, depth-2/fallback, Top Smoke, 20-case seeded Top and paired
trained QKV pass. Tiny timing now distinguishes array phases and unmeasured
transfer/commit; no unequal-boundary system speedup. Basic lint warning counts
remain inherited; no physical Fmax claim. Status DESIGN_PARTIAL. Exact commands,
raw artifacts, timing boundaries and risks: [review](design/schedule_optimization/REVIEW.md)
and [reproduction](design/schedule_optimization/REPRODUCTION.md).
