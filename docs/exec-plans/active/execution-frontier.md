# NMAForge execution frontier

Updated: 2026-10-21. This is a short handoff for the next engineering task; it
does not duplicate per-run evidence. The checkout is currently modified, so
results from the present session must not be described as a clean-SHA replay.

## Project baseline

NMAForge is a synthesizable AXI-Lite/AXI4 digital compute-near-memory
accelerator. The only chip integration top is `rtl/top/ai_accel_top.v`. Product
behavior comes from `docs/spec/SPEC_ZH.md` / `SPEC.md`; ownership and dataflow
come from `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Key architecture rules:

- `ai_spad_arbiter` is the only scheduler-side scratchpad admission point.
- `ai_command_processor` owns command lifecycle and queue-pointer advancement.
- Completion commits all four words before advancing the completion tail.
- AXI valid/ready, ID, LAST, back-pressure, reset, and abort-drain behavior
  must remain protocol-correct.
- Compute commands dispatch serially. The command-processor and compute-cluster
  formal runs verify this contract; parallel engine launch is unsupported.

## Current verification frontier

| Area | Current evidence | Open work |
|---|---|---|
| CNM, CNN/KV, FP, Matrix, SFU | Selected block/subsystem/top regression passed. Raw DUT-only code coverage is partial. | See [compute-engine status](../../verification/COMPUTE_ENGINE_STATUS.md) and [detailed run record](../../verification/COMPUTE_ENGINE_BLOCK_VALIDATION_2026-10-21.md). |
| A10 G0/V1–V5 | Current workstream status and strongest evidence are in the [A10 RTM](../../verification/A10_DV_RTM.md). | Full-domain FP parity proof, residual code/assertion coverage, broad interaction closure and fixed-SHA manifest remain open. |
| Static analysis | Evidence and license/tool boundaries are in [static analysis](../../verification/STATIC_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md), [SpyGlass triage](../../../dv/spyglass/LINT_TRIAGE.md), and [CDC/RDC status](../../verification/CDC_DUAL_CLOCK_DISPOSITION_ZH.md). | Resolve or disposition remaining warnings and advanced-tool gaps. |
| Physical and board | [TSMC28 report](../../verification/TSMC28_SYNTHESIS_REPORT.md) is pre-layout evidence; [XCZU15EG guide](../../verification/XCZU15EG_BRINGUP.md) defines board bring-up. | Post-layout multi-corner sign-off and board evidence are not claimed. |

## Next work

1. Freeze the reviewed source and test manifest, then rerun required gates on
   one clean SHA. Preserve the current dirty-tree evidence separately.
2. Continue the FP parity-to-writeback proof from the [FP formal frontier](../../../dv/block/compute/fp/formal/README.md); an inconclusive timeout is not a pass.
3. Review per-module raw code-coverage residuals and add targeted stimulus or
   proof for justified gaps. Current compute statistics are in the status page.
4. Expand cross-layer fault × abort × reset and queue/completion recovery only
   where the RTM identifies a missing requirement.
5. Keep LEC, DFT, post-layout PPA, and board results as separate closure gates.

## Canonical commands

Run from the repository root unless noted:

```sh
make -C dv/subsystem/tensor_datapath/sim cluster_regress
make -C dv/subsystem/top_smoke/sim ai_smoke
make -C dv/subsystem/top_smoke/sim ai_run AI_RANDOM_CASES=20 AI_SEED=12345
make -C dv/block/command_processor/formal completion-ownership
```

For RTL edits, run the focused target and `ai_smoke`. For queue, DMA,
scratchpad, top, or source-list changes, also run the seeded top regression
when the EDA environment is available. Record exact commands and PASS evidence
in the owning report; run `git diff --check` before handoff.
